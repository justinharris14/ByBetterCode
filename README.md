I helped convert the mixed multiplatform setup into a proper working Android app by cleaning up the project structure and fixing plugin issues. I started by resolving a Kotlin version mismatch between 1.9.22 and 1.9.24 in libs.versions.toml, then made sure the Compose compiler and dependencies were aligned. I enabled Compose in Gradle, set the Kotlin JVM toolchain, and added the correct dependencies. After that, I fixed the file structure by moving misplaced resources and manifests from androidMain into app/src/main/res, ensured the AndroidManifest.xml had the right package name and launcher activity, and removed the old CrecheConnectNavHost file that was causing conflicts. I then adjusted the source sets so that commonMain code could be recognized, added missing Compose imports like Box, Modifier, fillMaxSize, and replaced the placeholder nav host with Navigation.kt so the app launches on the Auth screen. Finally, I integrated Firebase by adding google-services.json, applying the Google services plugin, and initializing Firebase in MainApplication. After syncing and rebuilding, the app could launch successfully, initialize Firebase correctly, and display the Auth screen as intended.
